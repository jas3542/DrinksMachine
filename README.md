 Machine where you can order drinks

# How to run this project on local:

#TODO:
* Back button;
* A proper backend (api).
* Components for different type of drinks (Maybe).
* When Coffee selected ask the customer for Milk & sugar ( they should be optional, not everyone drinks coffee with milk or sugar).
* Bootstrap to improve fanciness
